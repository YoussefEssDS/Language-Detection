# Language-Detection
A machine learning tool for recognizing text language.

  This is an attempt to create a machine-learning based program. This program has for a purpose detecting the language of a given text via a task known as Natural language processing.
  This is the first step towards creating systems capable of providing many interesting services such as: a refined automatic translation, an emproved web search in terms of relevance, and also better performance for sentiment analysis tools.
  
  So, in this project I will use data from: http://www.statmt.org/europarl/ this website provides a massive datasets for any languages. Actually each file contains the speeches held at a certain european parliment session. To keep things simple I will only select 4 languages to be our targets: French, Spanish, Italian & Portuguese.
  
  So the idea is after I finish this program is to be able to type a text, and as an output get the language of the written text. 
This, by taking into consideration that we only will train our model(s) on 4 languages. 

  I will use neural networks, to train this model.
